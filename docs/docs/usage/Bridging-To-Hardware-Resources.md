# Bridging to Hardware and Network Resources

One of the most powerful features of Essentials is the ability to bridge SIMPL to and hardware resource to any piece of equipment instantiated inside of essentials.  You can bridge directly to a comport on the processor just as easily as you can to the comport of an instantiated DM device.  A simple change in the connection location of a display can be made with just a few keystrokes.  This isn't restricted to comports either.  Devices and direct connections can be linked to Digital Inputs, IR Ports, Relays, Comports, SSH, TCP/IP, UDP, and Cresnet resources.
