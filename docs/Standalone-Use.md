# Standalone application

Essentials was originally designed as a standalone SIMPL# Pro control system application and has developed into a versatile, pluggable application. This page describes how to use our built-in room types for a completely self-contained "one-slot" control program.

By defining devices and a room in a JSON configuration file, Essentials can control an entire AV control system for a room. A file can be manually created in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, or it can be generated by a friendly web-based configuration tool on [PepperDash Portal](http://pepperdash.com/products/), or some other configuration tool application, both requiring no knowledge of JSON.  These tools step a user through building the necessary devices and setting to achieve a full working room.
